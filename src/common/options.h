    //      frame) so the game accepts the next trigger pull sooner. RAPID FIRE OFF disables this branch.
    //      The weapons handled here:
    //        - RPG, GRL   single-shot launchers with slow reload
    //        - SNR, SN5   Walther 2000 bolt action (silenced / unsilenced)
    //        - BNS        M16A2 + M203: the M203 UNDER-BARREL GRENADE LAUNCHER's break-open / load / close
    //                     animation. The M16 primary fire is already fast via rapid_fire; the M203 alternate
    //                     fire is a single-shot launcher, and clearing its animation lets it fire
    //                     CONTINUOUSLY, WITHOUT PAUSE, WITHOUT DELAY, even though each grenade launches
    //                     individually. Requires INFINITE AMMO (the M203's alt ammo at +0xF8) so the
    //                     launcher does not run dry; INFINITE GRENADES is NOT needed for the M203 (that is
    //                     for hand grenades only).
    //
    //  (2) Hand grenades — gated by this toggle AND infinite_grenades ALONE. NO rapid_fire level required:
    //      grenades throw continuously, with no pause, no delay, no recovery window, even when RAPID FIRE
    //      is OFF. Each throw's release is detected the instant the count drops (sub_001E8830), and the
    //      throw animation, the held weapon's animation and the inventory busy flag are cleared right after
    //      the game's update (in ExtraRapidFire, cheats.cpp), so the next frame starts a fresh throw:
    //      ~2-3 throws per second at 60 fps (bounded by the throw animation's natural release frame).
    //
    // NOTE ON GRENADE RATE: neither the hand grenade throw rate nor the M203 fire rate scale with
    // rapid_fire level — both are bounded by their animation's natural release frames. What follows the
    // toggle is CONTINUOUS SPAM independent of the rapid_fire level. Scaling the rate would require
    // advancing the animation's time field each frame, which needs the animation controller's time-field

    //      does not drift off the crosshair between shots (same effect as NO RECOIL, but tied to this option
    //      so perfect accuracy also keeps the crosshair steady).
    // The fire animation still plays (a small muzzle climb, visual only), but the bullet direction is the
    // camera's, not the gun's, so all bullets hit the crosshair point. Most useful with a custom crosshair
